# Backspace-Up-Instead-Of-Back
In Windows Explorer: Makes backspace go up one level instead of going back to the previous folder.
Like in the days of Windows XP.

Download an EXE of this script, and place a link in the startup-folder. Then 

Or, if you are comfortable with AutoHotkey, use the source code in an AHK script.

This has been tested on Windows 10.
