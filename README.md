# Backspace-Up-Instead-Of-Back
In Windows Explorer: Makes backspace go up one level instead of going back to the previous folder.
Like in the days of Windows XP.

You can either 

1. [Download an EXE](https://github.com/plul/Backspace-Up-Instead-Of-Back/releases/) of this script, and place a link to it in the startup-folder. 
2. Or, if you are comfortable with AutoHotkey, use the source code as part of your own AHK script.

The script was tested on Windows 10.
